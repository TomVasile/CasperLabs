#NOTE: 1. Had to remove cached .sbt/.ivy2 dirs for drone autoscaling. This is because
# drone uses docker bind mounts which do not create the host dir if it is nonexistent,
# resulting in Error response from daemon: invalid mount config for type "bind":
# bind source path does not exist: /var/cache/cl-build/.sbt
#      2. Groups were replaced for a new depends_on feature in 1.*. These do not behave
# exactly the same.
