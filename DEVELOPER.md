## Developer's Guide to Building and Running CasperLabs

__Note__ Successfully building from source requires attending to all of the prerequisites shown below. When users experience errors, it is typically related to failure to assure all prerequisites are met. Work is in progress to improve this experience.

### Prerequisites

* [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net) Java Development Kit (JDK), version 11. We recommend using the OpenJDK
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
* [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)

  Welcome to Rust!

  This will download and install the official compiler for the Rust programming
  language, and its package manager, Cargo.

  It will add the cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands to Cargo's bin
  directory, located at:

    /Users/dev/.cargo/bin

  This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by modifying the
  profile file located at:

    /Users/dev/.profile

  You can uninstall at any time with rustup self uninstall and these changes will
  be reverted.

### CasperLabs Development Environment on ArchLinux

You can use `pacaur` or other AUR installer instead of [`trizen`](https://github.com/trizen/trizen).
```
TBD
```

Once the above prerequistes are installed for your environment, you are ready to build.

### How to build components

#### Build Wasm contracts:
Contracts are in a separate github repo: https://github.com/CasperLabs/contract-examples.
Clone this locally.

Make commands should build in the root of this repo.  `make all` or `make hello-name`.

If make fails, contract can be manually built:

  1. Go to contract directory that interests you (where Cargo.toml is defined), such as `cd hello-name/call`.
  2. To compile Rust contract to Wasm, run  `cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
  3. This puts `*.wasm` file in the `<root>/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` directory. We will use this file when deploying a contract.
  4. If `cargo build --release ...`  doesn't work try `cargo +nightly build ...`

#### Building node:

  1. Go to the root directory of CasperLabs.
  2. Run `sbt -mem 5000 node/universal:stage`

#### Building node's client:

  1. Go to the root directory of CasperLabs.
  2. Run `sbt -mem 5000 client/universal:stage`

#### Building Execution Engine:

  1. Go to the `execution-engine` directory in the CasperLabs root dir.
  2. Run `cargo build`

### Running components

For ease of use node assumes a default directory that is `~/.casperlabs/`  You must create this hidden directory: `mkdir ~/.casperlabs`.

#### Run the Execution Engine

In the root of the EE (`execution-engine`), run:

```
cargo run --bin casperlabs-engine-grpc-server ~/.casperlabs/.casper-node.sock
```

`.caspernode.sock` is default socket file used for IPC communication.

#### Run the node

In the root of CasperLabs.

[Generate secp256r1 key and X.509 certificate firstly](/VALIDATOR.md#setting-up-keys).

```bash
./node/target/universal/stage/bin/casperlabs-node run -s \
    --tls-certificate node.certificate.pem \
    --tls-key secp256r1-private-pkcs8.pem
```

### Deploying data

In the root of CasperLabs, run:

```
./client/target/universal/stage/bin/casperlabs-client --host 127.0.0.1 --port 40401 deploy --from 00000000000000000000000000000000 --gas-price 1 --session <contract wasm file> --payment <payment wasm file>
```

At the moment, payment wasm file is not used so use the same file as for the `--session`.

After deploying contract it's not yet executed (its effects are not applied to the global state), so you have to `propose` a block. Run:

```
./client/target/universal/stage/bin/casperlabs-client --host 127.0.0.1 --port-internal 40402 propose
```

For the demo purposes we have to propose contracts separately because second contract (`hello-name/call`) won't see the changes (in practice it won't be able to call `hello-name/define` contract) from the previous deploy.

Note that propose uses a different port then the deploy because it's considered an operator-only function, it's not part of the same interface.

### Visualising DAG state

In the root of the node, run:

```
./client/target/universal/stage/bin/casperlabs-client --host 127.0.0.1 --port 40401 vdag --depth 10 --out test.png
```

The output will be saved into the `test.png` file.

It's also possible subscribing to DAG changes and view them in the realtime

```
./client/target/universal/stage/bin/casperlabs-client --host 127.0.0.1 --port 40401 vdag --depth 10 --out test.png --stream=multiple-outputs
```

The outputs will be saved into the files `test_0.png`, `test_1.png`, etc.

For more information and possible output image formats check the help message

```
./client/target/universal/stage/bin/casperlabs-client vdag --help
```

## Information for developers

Assure prerequisites shown above are met.

### Developer Quick-Start

When working in a single project, scope all `sbt` commands to that project. The most effective way is to maintain a running `sbt` instance, invoked from the project root:

```
dev@dev:~/CasperLabs$ sbt
[info] Loading settings for project casperlabs-build from plugins.sbt ...
[info] Loading project definition from /home/dev/CasperLabs/project
[info] Loading settings for project casperlabs from build.sbt ...
[info] Set current project to casperlabs (in build file:/home/dev/CasperLabs/)
[info] sbt server started at local:///home/dev/.sbt/1.0/server/0415e009bb0a13209                                                                                                                                                             cb0/sock
sbt:casperlabs> project node
[info] Set current project to node (in build file:/home/dev/CasperLabs/)
sbt:node> stage
...
[info] Done packaging.
[success] Total time: 113 s, completed Jan 22, 2019, 10:53:37 PM
```

but single-line commands work, too:

```
$ sbt "project node" clean compile test
```

or

```
$ sbt node/clean node/compile node/test
```

### Building

The build is organized into several, mostly autonomous projects. These projects may be built (and used!) on their own, or they may be combined together to form the full node package. The build process in any case is contained in and controlled by a single, top-level `build.sbt` file. This process is able to produce several different kinds of artifacts, including JAR files (for Scala) and Docker images.

The most up-to-date code is found in the `dev` branch. This brilliant, cutting-edge source is periodically merged into `master`, which branch should represent a more stable, tested version.

#### Whole-project Build

Please check the prerequistes on your machine if the code generation fails.
Then build the whole project with all submodules:

```
> sbt compile
```

#### Packaging

To publish a docker image to your local repo run:

```
> sbt node/docker:publishLocal
[... output snipped ...]
[info] Step 8/8 : ENTRYPOINT ["\/bin\/main.sh"]
[info]  ---> Running in 2ac7f835192d
[info] Removing intermediate container 2ac7f835192d
[info]  ---> 5e79e6d92528
[info] Successfully built 5e79e6d92528
[info] Tagging image 5e79e6d92528 with name: casperlabs/node
[success] Total time: 35 s, completed May 24, 2018 10:19:14 AM
```

Check the local docker repo:

```
> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

openjdk             8u151-jre-alpine    b1bd879ca9b3        4 months ago        82MB
```

To deploy a tarball run:

```
> sbt node/universal:packageZipTarball
```

The tarball can be found in directory `node/target/universal/`

#### Running

```
TBD
```

Now after you've done some local changes and want to test them, simply run the last command `tbd` again. It will kill the running app and start a new instance containing latest changes in a completely new forked JVM.

### Cross-developing for Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) on a Mac

You will need a virtual machine running the appropriate version of Linux.

1. Install [VirtualBox]( https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install the Linux distribution you need (e.g. [Ubuntu](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.4-server-amd64.iso))
3. Start VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine in the manager
4. Boot your virtual machine using the Linux distribution ISO installed in step 2.
5. Configure your Linux VM as desired. You may need to install additional tools sucah as g++, g++-multilib, make, git, etc.

For a more convenient experience, you can share a folder on your Mac with the virtual machine. To do this you will need to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions. Unfortunately there are some gotchas with this. You may need to utilize one of these [solutions](https://askubuntu.com/questions/573596/unable-to-install-guest-additions-cd-image-on-virtual-box).

### Running benchmarks

Currently, only `BlockStore` and `DAGStore` benchmarks are done.
The recommended way to run them is to use `sbt` as follows:
```
 sbt "project blockStorage" "jmh:run -i 10 -wi 10 -f2 -t4"
```
This tells `sbt` to run `JMH` benchmarks from the `blockStorage` project with the following parameters:
- 10 warmup iterations
- 10 measuring iterations
- 2 forks
- 4 threads

This procedure requires machine with at least 32GB RAM.
This is a recommended way to run benchmarks.

There is also a properties file which could be use to configure some values: `block-storage/src/test/resources/block-store-benchmark.properties`

For more information about JMH, you can visit JMH project page: http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/

## Description of subprojects

### Communication

The [comm](comm) subproject contains code for network related operations.

```
TBD
```
