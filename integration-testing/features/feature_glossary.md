# Feature Glossary

This will hold common phrases used in tests and what they mean.  Because BDD using Gherkin has fixtures and assertions
created with phrases, it is important that these be common.

### Possible Other Networks needed:

 - "Partitioned Network"
   - Can we have a breakable network junction in docker?

## Account Creation

### "Account Funded {X} Nonce {Y}"

    - Account is created
    - Account is funded with {X} tokens

## Deploy

### "Deploy {Account} {Payment} {Session}"

    - Deploy using
        - {Account} for signing
        - {Payment} contract
        - {Session} contract

## Propose
